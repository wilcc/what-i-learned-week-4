js dom- Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

.querySelector- select certain elements and make changes.

.querySelectorAll- select all the same element as described, make sure use [] to choose afterward

.appendChild-to make child of

document.createElement("img,ul,p,etc")

.innerText-text form

.style- can be followed by .fontSize, .color .height .opacity .id etc

while loop - sample 
num = 3
n = 20
while (num <= n){
    console.log(num)
    num = num +3
}

num++ = num + 1

num-- = num -1

for loop = sample 
for (let i = 0; i < str.length ; i++ ){
    console.log(str[i].toUpperCase())
}
can set a 'counter' to help with some situations
